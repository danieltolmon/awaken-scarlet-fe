                  Living between India and Barcelona, Daniel embodies a spiritual way of life, weaving the wisdom of the East into the modern world. His journey unites ancient traditions with contemporary knowledge, merging mind and body, spirituality and science.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Daniel&apos;s path began in renewable energy engineering and software development, where he spent several years creating solutions for the physical world. However, life chose a different direction for himâ€”one dedicated to elevating human energy and dismantling limiting belief systems. His mission is to help people transform their perception of life and connecting them with their higher selves.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Through the practices of yoga, meditation, and tantra, Daniel has developed a heightened sensitivity to energy, allowing him to guide and empower individuals toward higher states of consciousness. He nurtures a collective shift towards a more aware and connected humanity, envisioning a future where spiritual awakening becomes the foundation for how we live, love, and grow as humanity.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Join Daniel on this journey towards the new era of spiritual awakening, where duality dissolves and we reunite with the divine.
